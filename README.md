# **Panel Data Analysis**
## üìñ Overview:
This project focuses on estimating a Cobb-Douglas production function to examine the intricate relation-
ships between agricultural inputs and outputs in China from 1986 to 1991. Leveraging a robust data set of
218 farm-level observations, panel data analysis is employed to capture multifaceted insights. The Pooled
OLS, fixed effects, random effects, and time-fixed effects models are used for this study. The study eval-
uates the importance of key inputs, including labor, capital, land, and intermediate inputs, and examines
trends in agricultural productivity over time. The ‚ÄúTrend‚Äù variable, which measures the impact of technical
change, has positive and statistically significant coefficients across all three models (Pooled OLS, Fixed Ef-
fects, and Random Effects) that point to a significant and steady increase in agricultural output over time.
This suggests that there has been continuous advancement or improvement in agricultural production tech-
nologies, methods, or efficiency between 1986 and 1991. The Fixed Effects model provides a more nuanced
understanding of the interactions between inputs and outputs within each entity (farm) with its inclusion
of individual-specific characteristics. The contrast between time fixed effects and fixed effects models leads
to the conclusion that individual-specific characteristics play a more crucial role in explaining the observed
variations within this data set. The analysis highlights the significance of panel data and how it influences
future agricultural plans and policy decisions.
